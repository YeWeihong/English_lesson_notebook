## Q&A  
1. Procrastination means that you should have the work done earlier, but you believe that you can defnitely finish that work ahead of time.But it eventually turns out that you can't. And you start to do something more interesting like playing computer games or watching TV, which makes you forget your mission until the deadline is approaching. This situation often happens, espeacially nowadays we study at home, sometimes you just can't control youself even though there are a lot of work to do, I have been there before.  
2. In my opinion, the reason why peolpe put off tasks until last minute is that they don't actually see the importance of the tasks, even 
though teachers have emphasized it many times. And our inborn laziness.Therefore we will invest our time in more comfortable tasks like playing games and watching TV, which will makes us happy. What's more, some people is always over-confident, and they think they can 
finish the tasks way before the deadline, but finally turns out that they don't have the ability to complete the work so effrctively than
they supposed, which leads to the puting off.
