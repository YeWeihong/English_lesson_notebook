## Debate  
### Technology makes people lazy?
* I think technology do make peolpe lazy. 
In past time, without smartphones, we will write a letter if you want to contact with your friend, 
and we got a lot of time to be with our friends and have more outdoor activities. 
All above can make us have a good relationship and good health. 
But please have a look at nowadays, peolpe becoming a coach potato, 
lying on bed and playing with cell phone, all these things is going to lead us into laziness. 
Actually, I am also becoming lazier and always delay some important things beacase of playing my cellphone. 
And teenagers like ordering Take-out food online instead of cook it by themselves. We may lose the ability to make a good meal. 
So, actually technology has many disadvantages, especially in peolpe's health and relationship.   
Thank you!

* My opinion is on the opposite, you will notice that without technology, we won't have this conversation on this onlone platform. 
Also, without technology we won't have lessons at home and that is bad for the students who are preparing for exams.  
Actually, I think laziness is not caused by technology, on the contrary, it's our laziness propel the development of technology. 
Laziness is inborn, every single peolpe likes lying on bed and doing nothing. Technology relaeses us from repetitive work, helps 
us finish our work more effectively, so that we can have more time to be with our family and friends like you said. Whan we finished 
our boring work fastly, we will have time to do the work we are interested in, like cooking a good meal, and learning how to play the 
guitar and so on. With Internet, many children in villages can have the same lessons as the children in cities have. 
Technology makes us smarter and more capacities, and make this world better.
